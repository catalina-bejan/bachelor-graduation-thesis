Surveillance System based on Computer Vision for people with Alzheimer's Disease

Bachelor Graduation Thesis marked with the highest grade (10) for developind a surveillance system (Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, Raspberry Pi Camera V2) for people with Alzheimer's Disease that would identify using Computer Vision techniques (models trained from scratch or using transfer learning for Image Classification, Object Detection, Human Action Recognition in Video) and store in a database the footage of the person eating or drinking and the prediction made.
The system would audio notify them to remind them when they sould eat (to avoid subnutrition), when they should stop eating (to avoid supranutrition) and when they should drink (to avoid dehydration). The system would also send notifications via email to a caregiver and would allow the caregiver to visualize through a Web app all the moments of interest saved in the database, schedule periods between meals and also see in real time remotely what the person with the disease is doing.
